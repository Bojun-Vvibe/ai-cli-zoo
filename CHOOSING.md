# CHOOSING.md — pick a CLI in 60 seconds

This is a decision tree, not a leaderboard. Start at the top and walk down.

## 1. Where does the model live?

- **Cloud-only is fine** → continue to step 2.
- **Must run locally / air-gapped** → [`aider`](clis/aider/) (Ollama),
  [`gptme`](clis/gptme/) (Ollama, llama.cpp), or
  [`continue`](clis/continue/) (any OpenAI-compatible local endpoint),
  or [`oterm`](clis/oterm/) for an Ollama-only multi-tab TUI with no
  cloud surface at all.
  Skip the rest of this tree.

## 2. Where do you live?

- **Terminal, full-screen TUI** → [`opencode`](clis/opencode/),
  [`crush`](clis/crush/), [`codex`](clis/codex/),
  [`claude-code`](clis/claude-code/), [`gemini-cli`](clis/gemini-cli/),
  [`OpenHands`](clis/openhands/) (CLI mode).
- **Terminal, REPL-style** → [`aider`](clis/aider/), [`gptme`](clis/gptme/),
  [`mentat`](clis/mentat/), [`plandex`](clis/plandex/).
- **Unix pipe primitive (no session, no UI)** → [`mods`](clis/mods/),
  or [`llm`](clis/llm/) if you also want every prompt logged to SQLite
  for later replay, or [`shell-gpt`](clis/shell-gpt/) if you want the
  output to default to a *shell command* you can execute inline, or
  [`tgpt`](clis/tgpt/) if you want zero-config no-API-key operation,
  or [`fabric`](clis/fabric/) if you want to apply a curated
  prompt-pattern library to whatever you pipe in, or
  [`files-to-prompt`](clis/files-to-prompt/) if you need to **pack a
  whole subtree** as deterministic context to pipe *into* one of the
  above (`files-to-prompt src/ --cxml | llm -m claude-sonnet '...'`).
- **Multi-turn REPL where the model writes and runs code** →
  [`open-interpreter`](clis/open-interpreter/) (any language, real
  machine, no sandbox), [`gptme`](clis/gptme/) (sandboxed-ish via
  Docker tool), or [`codex`](clis/codex/) (sandboxed via
  Seatbelt/Landlock).
- **Inside an IDE** → [`cline`](clis/cline/) (VS Code),
  [`continue`](clis/continue/) (VS Code + JetBrains).
- **GitHub-issue → PR, no local UI** → [`sweep`](clis/sweep/).
- **Greenfield "build me an app from a paragraph"** →
  [`smol-developer`](clis/smol-developer/).

## 3. How much agency do you want to give the model?

```
low  ◄────────────────────────────────────────────────────────►  high
aider     mentat     continue     opencode     codex     OpenHands     sweep
(diff       (diff      (suggest)   (tool-call    (sandboxed   (full Linux   (writes
 preview,    preview)               with         exec,         sandbox,      to your
 you `y/n`)                        approval)    auto-loop)    long runs)    main branch)
```

- **"Show me the diff before any write"** → `aider`, `mentat`.
- **"Approve each tool call"** → `cline`, `opencode` (default).
- **"Run a sandbox, just don't break my host"** → `codex`, `OpenHands`.
- **"Open a PR, I'll review on GitHub"** → `sweep`.

## 4. Do you need MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers?

- **Yes, must consume MCP servers** → `opencode`, `codex`, `cline`,
  `OpenHands`, `crush`, `continue`. All ship MCP clients.
- **No, prefer the CLI to bring its own tools** → `aider` (built-in repo-map),
  `gptme` (built-in shell/python/browser), `plandex` (built-in plan engine).

## 5. Multi-file, multi-step plans?

- **Single edit at a time** → `aider`, `mentat`, `cline`.
- **Multi-step plan with branches** → [`plandex`](clis/plandex/).
- **Long-horizon agent loop with sub-agents** → [`opencode`](clis/opencode/)
  (Task tool), [`claude-code`](clis/claude-code/) (Task tool, hooks, skills),
  [`OpenHands`](clis/openhands/) (multi-agent), [`forge`](clis/forge/)
  (YAML workflows with per-step model routing).
- **No plan, just transform stdin** → [`mods`](clis/mods/), or
  [`llm`](clis/llm/) if you also want a queryable history of every call,
  or [`fabric`](clis/fabric/) if you want a versioned, shared library
  of prompt patterns to apply to that stdin (`pbpaste | fabric -p
  extract_wisdom`).
- **Chat with a folder of documents from a terminal** →
  [`aichat`](clis/aichat/) (built-in RAG, single binary).

## 5b. Single-purpose workflow glue

Some niches are narrow enough that a dedicated CLI beats a general
agent. These are install-once-and-forget tools.

- **Auto-generate git commit messages from staged diff** →
  [`opencommit`](clis/opencommit/) (richer provider matrix,
  `prepare-commit-msg` hook story) or [`aicommits`](clis/aicommits/)
  (OpenAI-only by default, `-g N` multi-candidate picker UX).
  Pick `opencommit` if you want the hook installed once and
  `git commit` to "just work"; pick `aicommits` if you prefer
  choosing from N suggestions over editing one.
- **Generate Terraform / K8s / Dockerfile / GitHub Actions from a
  one-line description** → [`aiac`](clis/aiac/). Output is a clean
  IaC artifact (no markdown fences, no prose), ready to
  `terraform fmt && validate` or `kubectl apply`. Use it for
  greenfield scaffolding; for editing an existing IaC repo, switch
  to `aider` or `claude-code`.

## 6. Team / org constraints

- **Telemetry must be off by default** → all entries marked "Off" in the
  matrix: `opencode`, `aider`, `cline`, `crush`, `continue`, `mentat`,
  `gptme`, `smol-developer`, `mods` (no telemetry at all), `forge`,
  `tgpt` (no telemetry; note that free providers see prompts), `fabric`,
  `opencommit`, `aicommits`, `aiac`.
- **Permissive license required (no AGPL, no GPL)** → avoid `plandex`
  (AGPL core), `open-interpreter` (AGPL-3.0), and `tgpt` (GPL-3.0).
  **Source-available, not OSI-approved** → `claude-code` is excluded if
  you require an OSI license.
  Prefer Apache-2.0 / MIT entries.
- **Air-gapped CI** → `aider` + Ollama, or `continue` headless mode pointed
  at a local vLLM.
